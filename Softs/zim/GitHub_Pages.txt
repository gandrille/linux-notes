====== GitHub Pages ======

===== The issue =====
Since Zim is building static website, you can host the generated content on [[https://pages.github.com/|GitHub pages]].

If you are using a template which provides [[http://zim-wiki.org/manual/Help/Templates.html|resources]], all the resources will be copied to a ''_resources'' folder in the static website. And since GitHub pages is using [[https://jekyllrb.com/|Jekyll]], all the files and folder names starting with an underscore are ignored during the generation process… That's why, your ''_resource'' directory will be ignored in GitHub pages.

===== The "solution"… which does not work actually! =====
Since the issue is well known, [[https://help.github.com/articles/files-that-start-with-an-underscore-are-missing/|GitHub provides a walkaround]]. You can turn off Jeckyll by adding a .nojekyll file in the root path of the repository. It solves our issue… but now, you can't use the compression anymore !
That's why all modern browsers will not be able to access some ressources… whereas curl can.
This souds incredible, but depending if you are using the ''--compress'' flag with curl, you obtain a 200 or 404 error code.

===== The solution =====
Fortunately, [[https://help.github.com/articles/files-that-start-with-an-underscore-are-missing/|GitHub provides another walkaround]]. We can tell Jeckyll to parse ''_resources'' folder as any other standard folder. To do this, just add an ''_config.yml ''file in the root path of the repository with the following content : ''include: _resources''

And now, everything works as expected!
