====== Chromium ======
===== Flatpak install =====
https://flathub.org/apps/org.chromium.Chromium

For convinience, don't forget to create a launcher ''/usr/bin/chromium'' with the following content :
'''
#!/bin/sh
flatpak run org.chromium.Chromium "$@"
'''
â†’ This is a good way to wire Chromium flatpak to the default webbrowser

**ISSUE :** Playing mp4 files may not be possible since mp4 proprietary codecs are not available in the flatpak... and sandboxing prevents flatpak from using system codecs.

**Snap install**

**sudo snap install chromium**

flatpak-launcher  org.chromium.Chromium
