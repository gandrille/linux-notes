====== Alsa ======
* ''alsamixer'' graphical interface for ALSA
* ''amixer'' command-based utility for ALSA
* ''alsactl'' to store and restore a full configuration

===== amixer =====
''amixer -c [card-number] set [control] [value]''

**Set the volume on the Master control/property of the first sound card to 100%**
''amixer -c 0 set Master 100%''

**Set the volume on the Speaker control/property of the second sound card to 50%**
''amixer -c 1 set Speaker 50%''

**Set the volume on the Speaker control/property of the second sound card to 3db**
''amixer -c 1 set Speaker 3db''

**Increase the volume on the Speaker control/property of the second sound card by 2db**
''amixer -c 1 set Speaker 2db+''

**Mute and unmute a property**
''amixer -c 0 set Mic mute''
''amixer -c 0 set Mic unmute''

===== alsactl =====
By default the config is stored in ''/var/lib/alsa/asound.state''
''sudo alsactl store''
''sudo alsactl restore''

The configuration can be stored somewhere else, for instance
''alsactl --file ~/.config/asound.state store''
''alsactl --file ~/.config/asound.state restore''

===== IMPORTANT =====
At startup, pulse audio may load configuration.
see ''/etc/pulse/client.conf''
and check for ''autospawn'' 

**Walkaround:**

'''
#!/bin/sh
restore_alsa() {
    while [ -z "$(pidof pulseaudio)" ]; do
        sleep 1
    done
    alsactl restore 
}
restore_alsa &
'''



'''
crontab -e:
@reboot ~/alsarestore.sh 2>/dev/null
'''
