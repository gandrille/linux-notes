====== 4. Desktop files databases ======
{{./desktopDB.png}}
===== Databases location =====
The desktop files are stored inside well known directories: the desktop files databases.

**Databases locations** 
* at system level : ''$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications'' →  ''/usr/local/share/applications'' and ''/usr/share/applications''
* at user level : ''$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications'' → ''~/.local/share/applications'' 

And also...
* ''/usr/share/xfce4/applications''
* ''/usr/share/xubuntu/applications''

===== Lookuptable ''mimeinfo.cache'' =====
Each database ows a ''mimeinfo.cache'' file, generated by ''update-desktop-database'' command which parses all the desktop entries files inside the database to build a lookup table. 
For instance, ''update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/'' updates  ''~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache'' file.

**This lookup table provides**
* the list of desktop files associated for every MIME type. Here are a few examples:
	* ''application/csv=libreoffice-calc.desktop;''
	* ''application/ogg=audacity.desktop;org.xfce.Parole.desktop;vlc.desktop;''
	* ''application/rss+xml=firefox.desktop;''
* the list of desktop files associated for every scheme handler (a particulat MIME type, which uses the special ''x'' tree). Here are a few examples:
	* ''x-scheme-handler/http=firefox.desktop;''
	* ''x-scheme-handler/https=firefox.desktop;''
	* ''x-scheme-handler/magnet=transmission-gtk.desktop;''
	* ''x-scheme-handler/mailto=thunderbird.desktop;''
