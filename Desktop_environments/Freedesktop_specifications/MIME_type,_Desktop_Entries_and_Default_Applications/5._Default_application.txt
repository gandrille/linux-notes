====== 5. Default application ======

[[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mime-apps-spec/mime-apps-spec-latest.html|Association between MIME types and applications]] : « this specification solves the remaining issues: which application should open a file by default, how to let the user change the default application, and how to let the user add or remove associations between applications and mimetypes. » 

===== ''mimeapps.list'' file format =====
The information is located into a file called ''mimeapps.list''.

''mimeapps.list'' can contain the following groups
* ''[Default Applications]''
* ''[Added Associations]''
* ''[Removed Associations]'' for blacklisting (someting added by a ''mimeapps.list'' file can be blacklisted by another one)

Here is a basic example
'''
[Added Associations]
image/jpeg=org.gnome.gThumb.desktop;shotwell-viewer.desktop;gimp.desktop;ristretto.desktop;
audio/mpeg=vlc.desktop;

[Default Applications]
text/html=firefox.desktop
image/jpeg=org.gnome.gThumb.desktop
'''

===== ''mimeapps.list'' file location =====
* **user overrides, desktop-specific (for advanced users)** ''$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/$desktop-mimeapps.list'' → ''~/.config/xfce-mimeapps.list''
* **user overrides (recommended location for user configuration GUIs)** ''$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mimeapps.list'' → ''~/.config/mimeapps.list''
* **sysadmin and ISV overrides, desktop-specific** ''$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/$desktop-mimeapps.list'' → ''/etc/xdg/xdg-xubuntu/xfce-mimeapps.list'' and ''/etc/xdg/xfce-mimeapps.list''
* **sysadmin and ISV overrides** ''$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/mimeapps.list'' → ''/etc/xdg/xdg-xubuntu/mimeapps.list'' and ''/etc/xdg/mimeapps.list''
* **distribution-provided defaults, desktop-specific** ''$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications/$desktop-mimeapps.list'' → ''/usr/local/share/applications/xfce-mimeapps.list'' and ''/usr/share/applications/xfce-mimeapps.list''
**distribution-provided defaults** ''$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications/mimeapps.list'' → ''/usr/local/share/applications/mimeapps.list'' and ''/usr/share/applications/mimeapps.list''

* **DEPRECATED For completeness, desktop-specific** ''$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/$desktop-mimeapps.list'' → ''~/.local/share/applications/xfce-mimeapps.list''
* **DEPRECATED For compatibility** ''$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/mimeapps.list'' →  ''~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list''

===== Programs =====
**ASK for the default application for managing a mime type**
''xdg-mime query default text/plain'' → ''org.gnome.gedit.desktop''

**UPDATE the default application for managing a mime type**
''xdg-mime default org.gnome.gedit.desktop text/plain''

**Opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application**
''xdg-open myfile.jpg''

**xdg-utils package alternatives**
