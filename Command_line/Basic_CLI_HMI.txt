===== read line wrapper =====
''rlwrap [rlwrap-options] command ...''

''rlwrap'' runs the specified command, intercepting user input in order to provide readline's line editing, persistent history and completion.

''rlwrap''  tries  to be completely transparent - you (or your shell) shouldn't notice any difference between command and rlwrap command - except the added readline functionality, of course.  This should even hold true when you are re-directing, piping and sending signals from and to command, or when command manipulates its terminal settings.

There are many options to add (programmable) completion, handle multi-line input, colour and re-write prompts.
