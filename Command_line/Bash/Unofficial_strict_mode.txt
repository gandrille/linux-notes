* ''set -e'' will exit the script if any command returns a non-zero status code. To prevent the option from triggering on commands returning a non-zero status code even when no error occurred, there are two solutions:
* using the ''|| true'' pattern: ''command_returning_non_zero || true''
* temporary disabling the option:

'''
set +e
command_returning_non_zero
set -e
'''

* ''set -u'' will prevent using an undefined variable. In the case of undefined positional parameters (''$1'', ''$2'',…), you can give them a default value with the parameter expansion construct: '' my_arg=${1:-"default"}''
* ''set -o pipefail'' will force pipelines to fail on the first non-zero status code.
* ''IFS=$'\n\t''' makes iterations and splitting less surprising, in the case of loops mostly. The default for this variable is usually ''IFS=$' \n\t''' but the space as a separator often gives confusing results.
