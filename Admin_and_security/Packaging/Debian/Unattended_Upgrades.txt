====== Unattended Upgrades ======
The ''unattended-upgrades'' package can be used to automatically install updated packages, and can be configured to update all packages or just install security updates. It is installed by default on Debian 9 (Stretch) and on receant Ubuntu realeases.

===== What should be updated =====
Configuration file : ''/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades''

The key section is the following
'''
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
        "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}";
	"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";
	// Extended Security Maintenance; doesn't necessarily exist for
	// every release and this system may not have it installed, but if
	// available, the policy for updates is such that unattended-upgrades
	// should also install from here by default.
	"${distro_id}ESM:${distro_codename}";
	"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-updates";
//	"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-proposed";
//	"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-backports";
};
'''


===== Which operations sould be triggered =====
**Configuration file(s)**
The usual configuration file is ''/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades'' BUT all the files inside /''etc/apt/apt.conf.d/'' are evaluated in lexicographical order to compute the values to be used.

Key / value pairs
* ''APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";'' Do "apt-get update" automatically every n-days (0=disable)
* ''APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";'' Run the "unattended-upgrade" security upgrade script every n-days (0=disabled)
* ''APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";'' Do "apt-get autoclean" every n-days (0=disable)
* ''APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";'' Do "apt-get upgrade --download-only" every n-days (0=disable)

**Reading values**
Because the values can be configured in several files, it's preferable to use ''apt-config dump APT::Periodic'' in order to read the configuration.

**Writing values**
Editing the file ''/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades'' is a good practice. Here is an example of content:
'''
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
'''


===== Debug =====
''unattended-upgrade'' can be executed on demand. It can be usefull for testing the configuration. The script accepts several options
* ''--debug'' extra debug output into ''/var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades.log''
* ''--dry-run'' just simulate installing updates, do not actually do it

**Logs**
* ''/var/log/unattended-upgrades.log''
* ''/var/log/dpkg.log''
