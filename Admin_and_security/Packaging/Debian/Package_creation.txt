====== Package creation ======
Here are some info for building a Debian package.
Thoses notes are **NOT** in line with the best practices promoted by Debian since a package should be constructed from the sources. To that purpose, ''dpkg-buildpackage'' is the command to be used.

**Example**

'''
Package: hello
Version: 2.9-2+deb8u1
Architecture: amd64
Maintainer: Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>
Installed-Size: 145
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14)
Conflicts: hello-traditional
Breaks: hello-debhelper (<< 2.9)
Replaces: hello-debhelper (<< 2.9), hello-traditional
Section: devel
Priority: optional
Homepage: http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/
Description: example package based on GNU hello
 The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
 allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which 
 would otherwise be unavailable to them.
 .
 Seriously, though: this is an example of how to do a Debian package.
 It is the Debian version of the GNU Project's `hello world' program
 (which is itself an example for the GNU Project).
'''

* **Package:** the name of the binary package.
* **Version:** best practice is ''<major version>.<minor version>-<package revision>''
* **Architecture:**
	* ''all'' → same content on all architectures
	* ''any'' → It is needed to compile the sources for each architecture
	* ''amd64'', ''i386''… → only for a specific architecture
	* ''source'' → source package.
* **Installed-Size:** as an integer, in kilo-bytes. Used to ensure there is enough space left on the disk.
* **Section:** ''section/category'', but it's possible to provide only the ''category'' if section is ''main''
	* Section
		* ''main'': the free software
		* ''non-free'': the not really free software
		* ''contrib'': free software that depends on non-free software
	* Category
		* ''admin'' for administrator-only programs
		* ''devel'' for programmer tools
		* ''doc'' for documentation
		* ''libs'' for libraries
		* …
* **Priority:** usualy, it is ''optional''.

==== Advanced packages dependencies ====
**Virtual packages dependencies** 

''Depends: openjdk-8-jre-headless | java7-runtime-headless | java8-runtime-headless''

In this example, we want to have a Java7 or Java8 runtime, and we provide a default (''openjdk-8-jre-headless)'' in case we need to install a Java runtime.

* According to the [[https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#virtual-packages-provides|Debian Policy Manual]]: "To specify which of a set of real packages should be the default to satisfy a particular dependency on a virtual package, list the real package as an alternative before the virtual one."
* According to [[https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.package-meta-information.html|The Debian Administrator's Handbook]]: "Virtual packages used to suffer from some limitations, the most significant of which was the absence of a version number". The problem is that this feature is not (yet?) heavily used. That's why it's preferable listing the different virtual packages, instead of using a range operator.

**Usage of the tilde symbol (~)**

According to the [[https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#id22|Debian Policy Manual]]: "One common use of ~ is for upstream pre-releases. For example, 1.0~beta1~svn1245 sorts earlier than 1.0~beta1, which sorts earlier than 1.0."

The ''dpkg'' command can be used for trouble shooting:
* ''dpkg --compare-versions '1.0~beta1~svn1245' '>=' '1.0~beta1'; echo $?''
* ''dpkg --compare-versions '1.0~beta1' '>=' '1.0'; echo $?''

The tilde symbol can be used at the end of the string:
* ''dpkg --compare-versions '1.0~beta1~svn1245' '>=' '1.0~'; echo $?''
* ''dpkg --compare-versions '1.0~beta1~svn1245' '>=' '1.0'; echo $?''

==== Copyright file ====
This file has to be both machine and human readable… so its syntax is very strict.
See : [[https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/|Machine-readable debian/copyright file]]

==== Changelog file ====
This file has to be both machine and human readable… so its syntax is very strict.
See : [[https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#s-dpkgchangelog|Debian changelog, in the Debian Policy Manual]]

Thats' why the ''devscripts'' packet provides the ''dch'' tool to manipulate the changelog file.

''dch --create''
''dch --increment''

==== {pre,post}{inst,rm} ====
preinst, postinst, prerm and postrm are called package maintainer scripts.

===== Building the package =====

==== Understanding the choices ====
**dpkg-deb**
This is the very basic command for compiling. The one we are going to use
''dpkg-deb --build helloworld_1.0-1''

**Using a debian/rules file**
This is the modern way of doing things. 
The debian/rules file acts as a Makefile for building the packet, using the ''debhelper'' tools under the hood.
The key command is ''dh'' (introduced in 2008), which orchestrates the usage of all the ''debhelper'' tools.
Before 2008, ''CDBS'' (Common Debian Build System, introduced in 2005) was the only approach to create a simple and clean debian/rules file. For new projects, **CDBS** should not be used.

**Using dpkg-buildpackage**

===== Debian repository =====

==== Repository creation ====
Basically, a Debian repository is a folder accessible using HTTP protocol. This folder only needs to provides a descriptor named ''Packages.gz''.

* First, you need the ''dpkg-dev'' to be installed.
* Then, generate the ''Packages.gz'' file using the following command : ''dpkg-scanpackages /repository/root /dev/null | gzip -9c > /repository/root/Packages.gz''
* Of course, the repository folder needs to be served by an HTTP server.

==== Client configuration ====

Edit the ''/etc/apt/sources.list'' file (as an administrator) and add the following line : ''deb <repo url> ./''


''deb [trusted=yes] <repo url> ./''


''deb <repo url> ./'' by ''deb [trusted=yes] <repo url> ./''
