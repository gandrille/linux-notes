====== SecureBoot with UEFI ======
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). It's a replacement for the UEFI Basic Input/Output System (BIOS).

The UEFI 2.3.1 Errata C specification (or higher) defines secure boot, which can secure the boot process by preventing the loading of drivers or OS loaders that are not signed with an acceptable digital signature.

[[https://www.debian.org/News/2019/20190706|With Debian 10]] "The UEFI ("Unified Extensible Firmware Interface") support first introduced in Debian 7 (code name "wheezy") continues to be greatly improved in Debian 10 "buster". Secure Boot support is included in this release for amd64, i386 and arm64 architectures and should work out of the box on most Secure Boot-enabled machines. This means users should no longer need to disable Secure Boot support in the firmware configuration."
