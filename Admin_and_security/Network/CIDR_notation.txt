CIDR notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated routing prefix. The notation is constructed from an IP address, a slash ('/') character, and a decimal number. The number is the count of leading 1 bits in the subnet mask.

**Examples**
* ''/8'' (Class A) → subnet mask 255.0.0.0
* ''/16'' (Class B) → subnet mask 255.255.0.0
* ''/24'' (Class C) → subnet mask 255.255.255.0
