===== Config =====
**Basic config**
* ''<Left>'' force a screen redraw (if necessary)
* ''V'' forest view
* ''c'' toggle full command path
* ''W'' saves the modified configuration permanently to ''~/.toprc''
* ''d'' update delay

**Colors**
* ''z'' toggle color / monochrome mode
* ''Z'' configure color mode 
* ''B'' disable/enable bold

**Column selection and sorting **
* ''x'' highligh sorting column
* ''<'',''>'' use colum on the left or right as the sort field
* ''R'' reverse sorting order
* ''b'' change highlighting of sorting column
* ''f'' or ''F'' : colum selection and sorting interface

**Summaries**
* ''l'' toggle load average
* ''t'' toggle task/cpu stats
* ''m'' toggle memory info

**Memory units (from  KiB to EiB)**
* ''E'' change scale in summary area
* ''e'' change scale in task area

**Process interaction**
* ''k'' kill
* ''r'' renice

===== Undestanding default columns =====
* ''PID'': process ID (**sort key: N**)
* ''USER'': User Name
* ''PR'': Priority of the task
* ''NI'': Nice value
* ''VIRT'': total  amount  of virtual memory used by the task
* ''RES'': The non-swapped physical memory a task has used 
* ''SHR'': memory that could be potentially shared with other processes.
* ''S'': Process Status
	* ''D'' uninterruptible sleep: waiting for an I/O operation to complete
	* ''R'' running: executing on the CPU, or on the run queue (ready to be executed)
	* ''S'' sleeping: waiting for an event to complete
	* ''T'' traced or stopped (by a job control signal such as Ctrl+Z)
	* ''Z'' zombie: process has finished, but is waiting that his parent has read its exit status ([[https://vitux.com/how-to-create-a-dummy-zombie-process-in-ubuntu/|see more info]]).
* ''%CPU'':  CPU usage (**sort key: P**)
* ''%MEM'': pourcentage de la mémoire physique totale utilisé (**sort key: M**)
* ''TIME+'': total CPU time (**sort key: T**)
* ''COMMAND'':
