====== Sending signals ======
Remember that
* ''SIGINT'' = 2
* ''SIGKILL'' = 9

===== pgrep and pkill =====
**Examples**
* ''pgrep -u root sshd''
* ''pkill -HUP syslogd''

**Common options**
* ''-u user'' Only match processes whose effective user name or ID is listed.
* ''-f'', ''--full'' The pattern is normally only matched against the process name.  When ''-f'' is set, the full command line is used.
* ''-x'', ''--exact'' Only match processes whose names (or command line if ''-f'' is specified) exactly match the pattern.

**pgrep only**
* ''-l'', ''--list-name'' list the process name as well as the process ID.
* ''-a'', ''--list-full'' list the full command line as well as the process ID.

**pkill only**
''-signal'' ''--signal signal'' Defines the signal to send to each matched process.  Either the numeric or the symbolic signal name can be used.
* ''pkill -SIGINT ...'' or ''pkill -2 ...'' or ''pkill --signal SIGINT ...'' or ''pkill --signal 2 ...''
* ''pkill -SIGKILL ...'' or ''pkill -9 ...'' or ''pkill --signal SIGKILL ...'' or ''pkill --signal 9 ...''

===== kill command =====
Send a signal to a process refered by its PID. This is the most basic command.
* ''kill -2 100'' or ''kill -SIGINT 100'' send SIGINT to process which PID is 100
* ''kill 100'' send SIGTERM (default signal) to process which PID is 100

===== killall command =====
kill processes by name

* ''-s FOO'', ''--signal FOO'', ''-FOO'' Send signal FOO instead of SIGTERM. Either the numeric or the symbolic signal name can be used.
* ''-r'', ''--regexp'' Interpret process name pattern as a POSIX extended regular expression
* ''-u'', ''--user'' Kill only processes the specified user owns.  Command names are optional.

* ''-y'', ''--younger-than'' Match only processes that are younger (started after) the time specified.  The time is specified as a float then a unit.  The units are s,m,h,d,w,M,y for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, Months and years respectively.
* ''-o'', ''--older-than'' Match only processes that are older (started before) the time specified.  The time is specified as a float then a unit.  The units are s,m,h,d,w,M,y for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, Months and years respectively.
