===== Crash report management =====
There are TWO separate jobs
* generating the crash report: this is ''apport'' job
* uploading the crash report: this is ''whoopsie'' job
→ ''apport'' can trigger ''whoopsie'' by writing a ''.upload'' file in ''/var/crash'' 
see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ErrorTracker

==== Crash report generation ====
If the crash handler is ''apport'' (package installed by default on Ubuntu)
Crash reports are generated in ''/var/crash''

With file configuration: ''/etc/default/apport''
* ''enabled=1'' → apport is enabled
* ''enabled=0'' → apport is disabled

Using service management
* ''systemctl status apport.service''
* ''systemctl start|stop|enable|disable apport.service''

==== Crash report publication ====
''whoopsie'' package (previously ''reporterd'')
''/etc/init/whoopsie.conf''

''systemctl status whoopsie.service''
